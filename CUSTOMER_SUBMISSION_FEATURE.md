# Customer Submission Feature - Implementation Notes

## Overview
Customer submission system that allows customers to submit photos, feedback, and ratings from their perspective using validation codes provided by technicians.

## Feature Summary
- **Public customer form** at `/customer-submit` - no authentication required to view
- **Code-based validation** - customers need technician-provided code to submit
- **Customer perspective content** - photos, ratings, feedback from customer viewpoint
- **PWA integration** - shortcuts and offline support included

## Files Created (Ready for Implementation)

### Frontend
- `src/app/customer-submit/page.tsx` - Complete customer submission form
  - Customer info capture (name, email, phone, location)
  - Service description field
  - 5-star rating system
  - Photo upload (multiple files)
  - Customer feedback textarea
  - Code validation dialog

### API Endpoints
- `src/app/api/customer-content/route.ts` - Handles customer form submissions
  - Photo upload to Supabase storage
  - Data storage in marketing_content table with customer flag
  - Email/notification integration ready

- `src/app/api/validate-submit-code/route.ts` - Code validation system
  - Format validation (TECH-XXXX pattern)
  - Database lookup for technician codes
  - Fallback phone-based validation

- `src/app/api/generate-customer-code/route.ts` - Code generation for technicians
  - Creates unique codes per technician
  - Stores codes in technician records
  - Generates shareable customer links

### PWA Updates
- `public/manifest.json` - Added customer submit shortcut
- `public/sw.js` - Added customer-submit to cache

## Code System Design
- **Format**: `TECH-XXXX` (e.g., `BRE-1234` based on technician name + phone digits)
- **Storage**: `technicians.submit_code` field
- **Validation**: Multiple strategies (direct code match, phone-based fallback)
- **Security**: Prevents spam while maintaining easy customer access

## Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Add to technicians table
ALTER TABLE technicians ADD COLUMN submit_code VARCHAR(10);

-- Optional: dedicated customer submissions table
CREATE TABLE customer_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  technician_id UUID REFERENCES technicians(id),
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  customer_email VARCHAR(255),
  customer_phone VARCHAR(20),
  job_description TEXT,
  customer_feedback TEXT,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  location VARCHAR(255),
  additional_comments TEXT,
  photos TEXT[], -- Array of photo URLs
  submission_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'customer',
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'submitted',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Integration Workflow
1. **Technician generates code** via `/api/generate-customer-code`
2. **Customer receives link** (e.g., via SMS/email)
3. **Customer accesses form** at `/customer-submit`
4. **Customer fills out form** with photos and feedback
5. **Code validation** on submit
6. **Content stored** with customer perspective flag

## Benefits
- **Authentic customer content** - photos and feedback from customer viewpoint
- **No account creation** required for customers
- **Security maintained** through code validation
- **Mobile optimized** with PWA support
- **Marketing value** - genuine customer testimonials and photos

## Implementation Status
✅ Complete frontend form with validation
✅ API endpoints for submission and code generation
✅ PWA integration (shortcuts, caching)
✅ Database integration ready
⏸️ **PAUSED** - Ready to implement when needed

## Notes
- All files are complete and functional
- Database schema additions needed before activation
- Consider notification system for new customer submissions
- Could integrate with existing marketing content approval workflow
